## Examples
TODO lol

## What?
png2t is a fun little program that allows you to print out image or play a video format in a shell, so long as the shell supports ANSI escape codes!

## How?
png2t was written entirely in Rust! It currently depends on FFMPEG being installed to the system, but later versions of this will hopefully use an internal image library rather than external shell calls. png2t decomposes videos into .exr image files of each of their frames, loads them into memory, then prints them as individual RGB pixels using ANSI Truecolor sequences. It even plays the sound!

## Why?
It's cool!
